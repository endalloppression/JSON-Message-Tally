# JSON-Message-Tally
The application is written in C# 5.0 as a console application.  It iterates over log files found in the local directory C:\JSON Message Tally\logs.  
To utilize the application successfully you will need to create the folders "JSON Message Tally" in the C drive and then create a folder called "logs". 
Next download "logs - Software Engineer" from this reposiroty and unzip it to the logs folder within the C:\JSON Message Tally\logs directory.  This will allow the application to 
function normally. Without it, there will be an exception for the application during runtime.
